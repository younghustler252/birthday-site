    <h1>To My Babby – Eniola 💕</h1>
    <p>You stayed when I had little. You smiled when I couldn't. You loved me like no one else ever could.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why I Love You -->
  <section class="love-section">
    <h2>Why I Love You</h2>
    <p>Your beauty shines without trying. Your smile? My soft spot. Your heart? Rare. You don’t follow the crowd, and that’s why I see a queen when I see you.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- The Little Things -->
  <section class="love-section alt">
    <h2>The Little Things</h2>
    <p>I love how you call me <strong>“baby goat”</strong> 🤭, how you don’t act like other girls, how you're soft but strong, respectful but never fake. You’re truly my peace.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Promises -->
  <section class="love-section">
    <h2>My Promises to You</h2>
    <p>I may not have it all now, but I promise to grow. I’ll never stop trying to make you proud. I’ll keep your heart safe, just like you kept mine warm when I had little.</p>
  </section>

    They say pictures speak louder than words. I wish we had more moments together, but every picture of you is already a masterpiece.

    I wish we had more pictures together — more shared memories. But every glimpse of you is a full story on its own. I can't wait to create more with you.

    <h2>Our Moments</h2>
    <img src="./My ChatGPT image.png" alt="Couple Pic" class="couple-pic">
    <p>We don’t have many pictures yet, but the few we have mean everything to me.  
    I keep those memories in my heart — and I can't wait to make more with you.  
    Photos, dates, smiles, silly moments, forever things. Just us.</p>
  </section>
   
  <!-- Gift -->
  <section class="gift">
    <h2>Your Bracelet</h2>
    <p>This isn’t just beads — it’s a symbol. Of loyalty. Of us. Small in size, big in meaning. One day you’ll get more, but for now, I hope this reminds you of how much I love you.</p>
